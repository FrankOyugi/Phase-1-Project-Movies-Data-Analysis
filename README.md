# Phase-1-Project-Movies-Data-Analysis
# Overview
In this project,we will be using Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to analyze five sets of datasets and use our findings to provide recommendations to 'Microsoft',a company trying to get into the film-making industry.  
# Note  
I have mentioned in the project file that I had to copy the zippeddata folder into another folder outside the repository,extract the database,then make that folder my working repository.This had to be done because pushing the database after extraction was not possible because it exceeded GitHub's size limit.
# Business Problem
Microsoft have decided to create a new movie studio,but they are new to the film-making business.We will be exploring what types of films are doing the best at box office then using those findings to provide insights to the movie studio and help decide what types of films to create.The data questions I plan to answer to solve this problem include: 

1.What movies have been the highest-grossing each year?  
2.What are the trends in box office revenue over time?  
3.How are different movie genres performing?  
4.How do gender preferences vary across demographic groups?  
5.How do film ratings correlate with box office performance?  
6.Who are the major competitors in the film-making industry,and what type of films do they produce?  
7.What is happening with the highly popular streaming platforms?  
In this project,we will be analyzing 5 datasets which contain various information that includes:  

1.Movies  
2.The movie genres  
3.The movies ratings  
4.The target audiences  
5.Box office performance  
These dataset names are as follows:  
1.Box Office Mojo  
2.IMDB  
3.Rotten Tomatoes  
4.The MovieDB  
5.The Numbers 
# Methodology
The following analytical methods and techniques were used to analyze this data:  
1.Pandas: A python library used for data manipulation.  
2.Numpy: A python library used for numerical operations.  
3.Matplotlib: A plotting library in python.  
4.Seaborn: A data visualization library based on matplotlib.  

# Visualizations  
In this project some of the visualizations used include:
1. Heatmaps: Show correlation between two variables.

2.Histograms: Show the frequency distribution of a numerical variable.

3.Bar Chart: Used to compare two or more categorical variables.

# Recommendations.
From the results of data exploration and the visualizations that I've created,I would make the following recommendations to Microsoft:  
1.Invest heavily in the production budget.The heat maps show that their is a positive correlation between production budget and domestic gross.  
2.Focus on making documentaries and dramas.The histogram above shows that these two genres are the most popular ones.  
3.Hire 'Omar Pasha' as your writer and director.He has contributed to the highest number of films in this dataset.  
4.Avoid hiring 'Raphaelle Ayach' as your writer and director.He has contributed to the lowest number of films in this dataset.  
5.make movies which are between 90 and 110 minutes long.The average runtime is 100 minutes.
6.Do not make musicals and fantasies.They are the least popular genres.  
7.Target movie ratings of 6.5 or higher.6.5 is the average movie rating.
